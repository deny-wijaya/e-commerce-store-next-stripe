All colors, spacing, typography, and other design utilities **must** be sourced from `tailwind.config.js`.
**Avoid hardcoded values** like `#ffffff`, `12px`, `20rem`, etc. Use Tailwind utility classes or custom class names defined in your config.
Follow the defined project structure (e.g. Atomic Design, Feature-based, or Domain-driven).
Reuse existing components and avoid duplicating logic.
Keep your naming conventions clear and consistent (CardUserInfo.tsx, useFetchData.ts).
Avoid creating deeply nested folder structures unnecessarily.
